<h1>Hi, I’m Melory Ayala 👋</h1>

<p><b>UX Developer, Product Designer, Creative Thinker & Coffee lover.</b></p>
<br>


<p>I have +2 years of professional experience in UX and digital products. 
  I ended up falling in love with programming by the goal of getting ideas off the paper & Figma, and recently I have sharpened my skills in full-stack development. 
  Working with end-to-end projects, I have the ability to develop a project at any stage.
